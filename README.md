<strong>Title</strong>:  Semi-supervised Multi-task Facial Affect Recongition

<strong>Abstract</strong>:Automatic affect recognition has applications in many areas such as education, gaming, software
development, automotives, medical care, etc. but it is non trivial task to achieve appreciable perfor-
mance on in-the-wild data sets. In-the-wild data sets though represent real-world scenarios better
than synthetic data sets, the former ones suffer from the problem of incomplete labels. Inspired by
semi-supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce our submission to the Multi-Task-Learning
Challenge at the 4th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) 2022 Competition. The
three tasks that are considered in this challenge are valence-arousal(VA) estimation, classification of
expressions into 6 basic (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise), neutral, and the ’other’
category and 12 action units(AU) numbered AU-{1,2,4,6,7,10,12,15,23,24,25,26}. Our method
Semi-supervised Multi-task Facial Affect Recognition titled SS-MFAR uses a deep residual net-
work with task specific classifiers for each of the tasks along with adaptive thresholds for each
expression class and semi-supervised learning for the incomplete labels.
